# React Relay with Vite

A small repository showing how to correctly integrate React Relay with Vite.js.
I've also written a small tutorial [here](https://fhur.me/posts/how-to-setup-react-relay-with-vite).

## Setup:

Install dependencies by running

```bash
yarn install
```

Then start the relay compiler using

```
yarn relay --watch
```

Start the vite server using

```
yarn dev
```
